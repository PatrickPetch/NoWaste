# NoWaste
NoWaste project for 24Hackathon


The issue that our team has chosen to address is Food Waste under the themes Climate Action and Sustainable Cities. We have identified buffets and food and beverages store vendors in NTU as major sources of food waste. In order to address this, we will develop a mobile application that allows store vendors and users to list leftovers with images of the food item, details on expiry dates and allergen details. Interested users will then be able to proceed on site and collect the food item, thus reducing food waste. 
In addition, an endorsement system in the form of a ‘Likes’ and ‘Reviews’ section under every listing will be included to maintain the credibility of the promised food items. Users will have to create profiles within the application and create their own listings for leftover food. They will also be able to search and filter by their dietary preferences and location. 
In order to ensure accountability when listing items, users who opt to list their food items will have to get verification from other users before their listing appears in the global search. Store vendors will have a separate tier in their account, allowing them to bypass the verification step.
